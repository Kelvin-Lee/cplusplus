Some code intended to solve reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer problem #243, titled "Jenny's Fruit Basket".

The 'complicated' folder contains the .cpp and .h files intended to be used to
solve the problem, though they might be overly complicated, given the problem.
Regardless, good practice.

The 'simple' folder does not use any sort of class; it only uses (nested) for-loops.
