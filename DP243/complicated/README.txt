At its current state, the classes seem to work. Algorithm for actually solving
the problem is not yet working (currently looking to use
recrusion/backtracking).

Concepts practiced:
* operator overloading (assignment= and addition+)
* initializer lists and default parameters
* deep copy consturctors
* dynamic allocation
* pointers
* use of std::vector

Still need to write:
* custom destructors

No makefile, just use "g++ test.cpp"
